    <p class="blog-samples" style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 0;">
        As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), Asthma is a long-term condition affecting children and adults. The air passages in the lungs become narrow due to inflammation and result in the tightening of the muscles around the small airways. This causes asthma symptoms: cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. These symptoms are intermittent and are often worse at night or during exercise. Other common ‘triggers’ can make asthma symptoms worse. Triggers vary from person to person but can include viral infections, dust, smoke, fumes, changes in the weather, grass and tree pollen, animal fur and feathers, strong soaps, and perfume.
        <br>
        A variety of factors have been linked to an increased risk of developing asthma, although it is often difficult to find a single, direct cause. Asthma is a condition with no known cure but whose symptoms can be effectively managed with the right treatment.

    <p class="blog-samples" style="padding: 0 50px">The symptoms of asthma include the following:</p>
    
    <p class="blog-samples" style="padding: 0 50px">
      <ul style="padding: 0 50px" class="blog-samples">
          <li>
            Breathlessness (rapid breathing) – The medical term for shortness of breath is Dyspnea. An asthmatic will not be able to get enough air in and out of their lungs and will find it difficult to breathe. This is caused due to the inflammation of the airway lining. It can be experienced even after light or moderate physical activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wheezing – This high-pitched noise can be experienced while breathing. A whistling or squealing sound is often heard when breathing. In asthma, wheezing is caused due to narrowing of the lower airways.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continuous coughing – Coughing occurs due to the bronchial secretions of mucus and is related to airway inflammation and direct sensitivity to trigger. Asthmatics experience continuous severe coughing that stays for a longer period. This symptom can also occur at night or even after exercising. At times coughing can be accompanied by a wheezing sound.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tightness in the chest – Chest tightening is many times described as a heavy feeling of weight on the chest. The tight feeling in the chest is due to the contraction of airway muscles. It can feel like a dull ache or a sharp stabbing in the chest. This makes it difficult for a person to take deep breaths.
